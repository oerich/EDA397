# Agile Development Processes - lp4, vt2016

- Lecture 9 (Continuous SE Challenges) online
- Added plan to discuss exam next week


Last update: 2016-05-10

## Course Description
Agile software development aims at setting up an environment to develop software based on the following principles from the agile manifesto:

- Individuals and interactions is valued more than processes and tools
- Working software is valued more than comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration is valued more than contract negotiation
- Responding to change is valued more than following a plan

At the core of these principles it the realization that changes are inevitable and the conclusion that change management needs to be integrated into the development process. *Agile approaches* promotes iterative and incremental development by using a very tight *design-code-test* cycle.

In this interactive course we will explore together how to apply these agile principles to develop software and manage projects.

After passing the course, you will be able to lead agile projects, use test driven development, refactor programs, be part of a programming pair, and much more.

## Lectures and Workshops (In progress…)

This lecture is organized in three sprints.

- **Sprint 1 (focus on getting started):** We will focus on getting you started and discuss agile principles and actionable practices. Also, we will set up the project work.
- **Sprint 2 (focus on getting work done):** We will focus on working in teams, applying agile practices, and collecting experience.
- **Sprint 3 (focus on theory and advanced concepts):** Based on your experience in project work, we will explore more theoretical and advanced topics of agile software development.

Below you can see the date, time, room and themes for the lectures and workshops. There is also a detailed schedule in [TimeEdit].

**NOTE!** We have booked extra time in the project rooms where you should work on the project but when there will not always be assistants on site for support.

See [wiki](https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Reading-Instructions) for reading instructions.

Acceptance tests will generally be on Thursdays, 13:00-17:00. We aim for two week sprints and will share a schedule, once project groups are established.

**NOTE!** We plan one sprint ahead in detail and will add information as we go. The reason is that some of the planning depends on availability of (industry) guest speakers, and their lectures are to be confirmed.

## Examination
The examination consists of three parts:

1. A **Software Development project** where you work in groups to develop an Android or iOS app using agile practices.

2. A  **[Post-mortem Report][PMR]** that outlines your group's experience with agile practices during the software development project.

3. A **Written exam**  based on the main course book, the papers listed in the table above and the material presented in lectures as well as on your project.

To pass the course it is extremely important that you read all the course material, participate in lectures and are active in and finish your project. If you do not, you will fail! Remember that this is a master level course and requires considerably more than most bachelor level courses.

Your final grade will be set according to the [Grading Policy][GP]

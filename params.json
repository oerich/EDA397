Also, we will set up the project work.\r\n- **Sprint 2 (focus on getting work done):** We will focus on working in teams, applying agile practices, and collecting experience. Teaching will focus on industrial practice.\r\n- **Sprint 3 (focus on theory and advanced concepts):** Based on your experience in project work, we will explore more theoretical and advanced topics of agile software development.\r\n\r\nBelow you can see the date, time, room and themes for the lectures and workshops. There is also a detailed schedule in [TimeEdit].\r\n\r\n**NOTE!** We have booked extra time in the project rooms where you should work on the project but when there will not always be assistants on site for support.\r\n\r\nSee [wiki](https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Reading-Instructions) for reading instructions.\r\n\r\nAcceptance tests will *always* be on Thursday at 13:00-17:00.\r\n\r\n### Sprint 1: Focus on getting started\r\n\r\n| Date & Time | Room(s) | Theme |Who | Slides | Videos | Readings |\r\n|  ------\t| :----:\t| ------\t| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------ |  \r\n| Mar-24 *15:15-17:00* | Alfa | Course Introduction, overview of Agile, course Q&A, assigning groups | EA | [L1] | | [Cockburn2009, Ch. 4], [Cohen04] |  \r\n| Mar-26 *13:15-17:00* | Gamma |  Agile Software Development: Principles and Practices | EA | [L2] | | [Schwaber95]|  \r\n| Mar-27 *13:15-15:00* | Omega | Get started with groups;

A **Software Development project** where you work in groups to develop an Android or iOS app using agile practices.\r\n\r\n2. A  **[Post-mortem Report][PMR]** that outlines your experience with agile practices during the software development project. (individual)\r\n\r\n3. A **Written exam**  based on the main course book, the papers listed in the table above and the material presented in lectures as well as on your project.\r\n\r\nTo pass the course it is extremely important that you read all the course material, participate in lectures and are active in and finish your project. If you do not you will fail! Remember that this is a master level course and requires considerably more than most bachelor level courses.\r\n\r\nYour final grade will be set according to the [Grading Policy][GP]\r\n\r\n[GP]: https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Grading-Policy\r\n[PMR]: https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Post-mortem-Report\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

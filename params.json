Please consider volunteering. We will share information about student representatives and our meetings on the following wiki page:\r\nhttps://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/course-representatives\r\n\r\n## Course Literature\r\n\r\n- Cockburn, A., (2009) [Agile Software Development, 2ed](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Software-Development-Cooperative-Game/dp/0321482751/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1300358686&sr=8-3) (ISBN: 0321482751)\r\n- Papers (available from lecture list)\r\n\r\n## Lectures and Workshops (In progress…)\r\n\r\nThis lecture is organized in three sprints.\r\n\r\n- **Sprint 1 (focus on getting started):** We will focus on getting you started and discuss agile principles and actionable practices. Also, we will set up the project work.\r\n- **Sprint 2 (focus on getting work done):** We will focus on working in teams, applying agile practices, and collecting experience.\r\n- **Sprint 3 (focus on theory and advanced concepts):** Based on your experience in project work, we will explore more theoretical and advanced topics of agile software development.\r\n\r\nBelow you can see the date, time, room and themes for the lectures and workshops. There is also a detailed schedule in [TimeEdit].\r\n\r\n**NOTE!** We have booked extra time in the project rooms where you should work on the project but when there will not always be assistants on site for support.\r\n\r\nSee [wiki](https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Reading-Instructions) for reading instructions.\r\n\r\nAcceptance tests will generally be on Thursdays, 13:00-17:00. We aim for two week sprints and will share a schedule, once project groups are established.\r\n\r\n**NOTE!** We plan one sprint ahead in detail and will add information as we go. The reason is that some of the planning depends on availability of (industry) guest speakers, and their lectures are to be confirmed.\r\n\r\n### Sprint 1: Focus on getting started\r\n\r\n| Date & Time | Room(s) | Theme |Who | Slides | Videos | Readings |\r\n|  ------\t| :----:\t| ------\t| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------ |  \r\n| Mar-22 *15:15-17:00* | Alfa | Course Introduction, overview of Agile, course Q&A, assigning groups | EK | [L1] | | [Cockburn2009, Ch. 4], [Cohen04] |  \r\n| Mar-24 *13:15-17:00* | Beta | Get started with groups; working environment; Project Startup, incl. 1st customer meeting | TB, MA, | [L2] | | [Android][get started Android], [AndroidExamples] |\r\n| Easter Break | |  | | | | | |\r\n| Apr-12 *13:15-15:00* | Styrbord (near Äran) | Miniature on Agile Software Development Principles | EK | [L3] | | [Cockburn 2009, Appendix A] |\r\n| Apr-14 *13:15-17:00* | indiv. announcement | Acceptance test, Sprint retrospective, Sprint planning | TB, MA |  | | |\r\n| Apr-15 *13:15-15:00* | Gamma |  Agile Software Development: Principles and Practices | EK | [L4] | | [Schwaber95], [Scrum guide] |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sprint 2: Focus on getting work done\r\n\r\n| Date & Time | Room(s) | Theme | Who | Slides | Readings |\r\n|  ------\t| :----:\t| ------\t| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------ |  \r\n| Apr-19 13:15 -

A **Software Development project** where you work in groups to develop an Android or iOS app using agile practices.\r\n\r\n2. A  **[Post-mortem Report][PMR]** that outlines your group's experience with agile practices during the software development project.\r\n\r\n3. A **Written exam**  based on the main course book, the papers listed in the table above and the material presented in lectures as well as on your project.\r\n\r\nTo pass the course it is extremely important that you read all the course material, participate in lectures and are active in and finish your project. If you do not, you will fail! Remember that this is a master level course and requires considerably more than most bachelor level courses.\r\n\r\nYour final grade will be set according to the [Grading Policy][GP]\r\n\r\n[GP]: https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Grading-Policy\r\n[PMR]: https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Post-mortem-Report\r\n[AT]: https://github.com/oerich/EDA397/wiki/Acceptance-Tests\r\n",
